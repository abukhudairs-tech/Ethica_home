## Idea 1: Earthen Modernism (Selected)
**Design Movement:** Modern Rustic / Japandi
**Core Principles:** Warmth, Simplicity, Texture, Authenticity. The design should feel grounded and tactile, reflecting the handmade nature of the products.
**Color Philosophy:** A palette derived from natural materials.
- **Primary:** Warm Sand / Beige (Backgrounds)
- **Secondary:** Deep Forest Green (Trust, Nature)
- **Accent:** Terracotta / Burnt Sienna (Craftsmanship, Warmth)
- **Text:** Dark Charcoal (Softer than black)
**Layout Paradigm:** Asymmetric grids with overlapping elements to break rigidity. Generous whitespace to let products breathe. Avoid standard "box" layouts; use organic spacing.
**Signature Elements:**
- Subtle grain/paper texture overlays.
- Soft, rounded corners (but not fully pill-shaped).
- Serif headings for elegance, paired with clean sans-serif body.
**Interaction Philosophy:** Gentle, slow-fade transitions. Hover effects should be subtle color shifts or slow zooms, not jerky movements.
**Animation:** Slow ease-in-out, organic motion. Elements should "float" into place.
**Typography System:**
- **Headings:** 'Lora' or 'Playfair Display' (Serif) - evokes tradition and quality.
- **Body:** 'Montserrat' or 'Lato' (Sans-serif) - modern and legible.

# Selected Design: Earthen Modernism
We will proceed with **Earthen Modernism**. This style best communicates the "fair-trade" and "homeware" aspects by creating a digital environment that feels like a warm, well-curated home. It balances the rustic nature of the products with a modern, trustworthy e-commerce experience.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use `Lora` for headings and `Montserrat` for body text.
- Implement a subtle noise texture on the background.
- Use a color palette of Warm Beige (`#F5F2EB`), Forest Green (`#2C4C3B`), and Terracotta (`#C07A50`).
